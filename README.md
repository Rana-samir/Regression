🏡 Predicting House Prices (California Housing Dataset)

This project focuses on predicting house prices using the California Housing Dataset.
Throughout the notebook, I applied several important data science concepts, including:

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Deep exploration of data distributions, correlations, and patterns.

🧹 Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing features.

✂️ Outlier Detection & Removal: Identifying and removing extreme values to improve model performance.

⚙️ Machine Learning Pipelines: Automating preprocessing steps such as scaling and transformation.

🏠 House Price Prediction: Building and evaluating models to accurately predict housing prices.
